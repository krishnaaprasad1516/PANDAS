 # pandas: powerful Python data analysis toolkit
#  What is it?
pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way towards this goal.

 #  Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:

- Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN, NA, or NaT) in floating point as well as non-floating point data
 - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects
 - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations
 - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data
 - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects
 - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets
 - Intuitive merging and joining data sets
 - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
 - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)
 - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format
 - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging
